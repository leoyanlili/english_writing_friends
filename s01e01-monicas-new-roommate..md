# S01E01: Monica's New Roommate.

S01E01: Monica's New Roommate.

In the first scene, all the friends get together in a cafe. Monica, Rachel, and Ross come out with the beginning of their own stories, we can figure out that there's got to be three storylines in this episode.

&#x20;

Storyline\_01 Monica's date with the wine guy:

Monic is dating a colleague, named Paul, they call him the Wine guy because his job is selling wine to the customers of the restaurant where he works for. Paul comes and asks Monica for dinner. Everybody, especially her brother Ross, is happy for Monica's 5th "not a real date" date just like Chandler says: " A dear diary moment.". Paul tells Monica that he has not been able to perform sexually for 2 years after his ex-girlfriend walked out on him for a dentist. That night, it becomes a real date( they had a physical relationship). Monica is happy only until late the next day, one of her female colleagues tells her the same story about Paul, It turns out that Paul makes a line about his experience. Maybe Ross is a man who wants to point everything out: "Paul did this to get you into bed"(Is there any more sophisticated expression? let me know.). You can imagine how Monica is disappointed with this short relationship ended by her stomping on Paul's watch left on the floor.

&#x20;

Storyline\_02 Rachel escapes from her wedding:

With the wedding dress on, Rachel is running into this cafe and is recognized by Monic. These two friends have drifted apart for years. She escaped right before the wedding because it hit her that she doesn't love the man whom she is going to marry (For Rachel, he looks like Mr. potato, even a gray boat can turn on her more easily than the man, haha). Real love really matters to her. Rachel still can not keep herself from consuming expensive brands with her father's credit cards. She was laughed out of 12 interviews, nevertheless, she is still upbeat. Although Rachel is still a Daddy's girl, you'll see how she grows up after her cutting off the credit cards under her father's name with the encouragement of her friends. She starts with a waitress in this cafe.

&#x20;

Storyline\_03 Ross's lesbian ex-wife left him :

Ross's wife is a lesbian, she moved out for another woman and became the ex- for Ross. He must be very desperate on this rainy day. She herself didn't know that lesbian thing before, how could Ross know it? I guess he should catch on when she always drank the soda out of the can(like a man :-)). Let's don't fixate on this. Joey offers him two pieces of advice, a strip joint and an analogy with different ice cream flavors to refer to different women. It sounds great for an American young man to hell with the last relationship. When the three guys are assembling Ross's new furniture, I guess Ross is also trying to put himself together from his last marriage, he squatly can not find the bracket-y things and worm things that express his messing inside. Therefore, the furniture is a metaphor for our sad Ross. I am kind of starting to like the playbook.

&#x20;

Miscellaneous thoughts:

1\) Maybe Joey is right in the first scene, he said "There's got to be something wrong with him". Later the day, Phoebe said: "I just pulled out four eyelashes, that can't be good". Bingo...End of the story...

2\) The director has started to build the relationship between Ross and Rachel which we can tell from the last scene in the apartment. Ross is a geeky boy in his bone. Back in high school, he had a major crush on her. Today, our Ross happens to catch the chance. It is also super funny that after Rachel responds "yes" to Ross's "maybe I ask you out", he is looking at the split cookie and talks to himself: "maybe I will...", haha, he is kind of geeky but pretends to be cool, right? I guess Rachel has a similar feeling.

3\) We can conclude Joey is definitely a lady's man, from his pieces of advice to Ross and hitting on Rachel when Monica is comforting her.



Anyway, from this very beginning episode, who is your favorite character? and why?
